# lazy-language-loader
lazy-language-loader improves loading times when changing your language by only reloading the language instead of all the game resources!

## Background
Currently, when you load in a language on lower-spec computers it takes quite a noticeable amount of time...
This mod aims to fix that massive freeze-up by instead of reloading all the game resources just reload
the language manager. The language manager handles game translations/localization etc. By using this mod
the delay should be very less noticeable due to no longer reloading every resource.
